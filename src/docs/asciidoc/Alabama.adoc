*VERSE:*
....
*F*  G     Em7
Oh oh Alabama,
F         G              F         C
The devil fools with the best laid plans
F     G      Em7
Swing low Alabama.
F                          D
You got the spare change - you got to feel strange
E                  F           G
And now the moment is all that it meant.
....
*CHORUS 1:*
====
*Am*
Alabama - you got the weight on your shoulders
C            D
That's breaking your back.
Am
Your cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
C            D
And a wheel on the track.

*F*  G     Em7
Oh oh Alabama,
F      G                   F      C
Banjos playing through the broken glass
F       G          Em7
Windows down in Alabama
F                 D
See the old folks tied in white ropes
E                F                 G
Hear the banjos, don't it take you down home

Oh oh Alabama,
Can I see you and shake your hand
Make friends down in Alabama.
I'm from a new land, I come to you and
See all this ruin, What are you doing?

Alabama - you've got the rest of the Union
D
To help you along
Am
What's going wrong?
